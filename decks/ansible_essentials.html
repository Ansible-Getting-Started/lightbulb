            <h2>WHAT IS ANSIBLE AUTOMATION?</h2>
            <p>The Ansible project is an open source community sponsored by Red Hat. It’s also a <strong>simple automation language</strong> that perfectly describes IT application environments in <strong>Ansible Playbooks</strong>.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Ansible Engine</strong> is a <strong>supported product</strong> built from the Ansible community project.
            <br><br>
            Ansible Tower is an <strong>enterprise framework</strong> for controlling, securing, managing and extending your Ansible automation (community or engine) with a <strong>UI and RESTful API</strong>.</p>
            <br><br>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>The Ansible Project is open source and sponsored by Red Hat.
                Ansible Engine is a supported product built from the Ansible community project, and Ansible Tower is the framework for the automation that Ansible Engine does.
                There’s also an open-source version of Tower which is the AWX project, and it’s associated with the Ansible GitHub.</p>

            <h2>WHY ANSIBLE?</h2>
            <p><img src="images/why_ansible.jpg"></p>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>So why should you think about using Ansible and what sets it apart?
              First off, Ansible is simple: we expect that your user base is going to be mixed with people of all skill levels and because of that we wanted to make it incredibly easy to get started.  The language playbooks are written in is YAML, which is very easy-to-read for humans, and those playbooks work consistently across many environments
              It’s also extremely powerful in how many nodes we can spin up and manage at any given time, which is largely due to the fact that Ansible is agentless.  There are no agents to keep up to date and the requirements are minimal.
              </p>
            </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>THE ANSIBLE WAY</h2>
          <p><font color="52AAAC"><strong>CROSS PLATFORM – Linux, Windows, UNIX</strong></font><br>
          Agentless support for all major OS variants, physical, virtual, cloud and network.</p>
          <p><font color="52AAAC"><strong>HUMAN READABLE – YAML</strong></font><br>
          Perfectly describe and document every aspect of your application environment</p>
          <p><font color="52AAAC"><strong>PERFECT DESCRIPTION OF APPLICATION</strong></font><br>
          Every change can be made by playbooks, ensuring everyone is on the same page.</p>
          <p><font color="52AAAC"><strong>VERSION CONTROLLED</strong></font><br>
          Playbooks are plain-text. Treat them like code in your existing version control.</p>
          <p><font color="52AAAC"><strong>DYNAMIC INVENTORIES</strong></font><br>
          Capture all the servers 100% of the time, regardless of infrastructure, location, etc.</p>
          <p><font color="52AAAC"><strong>ORCHESTRATION THAT PLAYS WELL WITH OTHERS – HP SA, Puppet, Jenkins, RHNSS, etc.</strong></font><br>
          Homogenize existing environments by leveraging current toolsets and update mechanisms.</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>In addition, that agentless support isn’t just Linux exclusive.
              This also applies to Windows machines, networking devices, and of course both physical and cloud servers, as well as static or dynamic inventory.
              Also, one of the main selling points of Ansible is that we work well with existing toolkits.
              Sometimes people don’t know where to start; I’d advise you to pick a pain point in your environment to focus on, something small that you can leverage Ansible for and see how that feels, because you can always homogenize over time.

          <h2>BATTERIES INCLUDED</h2>
          <p>Ansible comes bundled with hundreds of modules for a wide variety of automation tasks:</p>
          <div style="float: left; width: 50%;">
          <ul>
          <li>cloud</li>
          <li>containers</li>

          <li>files</li>
          <li>messaging</li>
          <li>monitoring</li>
          <li>network</li>
          </ul>

          <li>utilities</li>
          <li>web infrastructure</li>
          </ul>
          </div>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Installing Ansible nets you a TON of modules that range in type from the popular cloud modules to packaging and database modules.
              The list you see here are some of the “high profile” modules, but there are lots more that aren’t listed.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>COMMUNITY</h2>
          <p><font color="52AAAC"><strong>THE MOST POPULAR OPEN-SOURCE AUTOMATION COMMUNITY ON GITHUB</strong></font><br></p>
<!-- Remember to check the numbers listed below!!  -->
          <ul>
            <li>31,000+ stars & 12,000+ forks on GitHub</li>
            <li>3500+ GitHub Contributors</li>
            <li>Over 1500 modules shipped with Ansible</li>
            <li>New contributors added every day</li>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Plus Ansible has an amazing community.  We have tons of contributors and active participants on IRC and in our Google project list. We have about 500,000 downloads a month, which is really exciting to know that so many people use this automation tool.
              I’d actually like to take this opportunity to mention this year’s AnsibleFest going on during the first week of October in Austin, TX, as well as numerous Ansible Automates events happening all over the world and in the US during the last three months of this year.  If you can attend any of those, we’d love to see you there!

          <h2>ANSIBLE: COMPLETE AUTOMATION</h2>
          <p><img src="images/complete_automation.jpg"></p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>One of the other bullet points that we highlight around Ansible is that it’s the complete package.
              So it’s not just configuration management; it’s also orchestration, app-deployment and provisioning as well.
              Looking at this graphic here , you can see that there are tools that definitely perform one or more of these use cases, but can’t do them all and that’s really one of the big strengths of Ansible.
              Some users like to refer to it as “Automation Glue”.</p>

            <p>Automate the deployment and management of your entire IT footprint.</p>
            <p><img src="images/ansible_possibilities.jpg"></p>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>On this slide, you can see the different use cases for how to manage and automate your machines.
                (some examples are: security and compliance, orchestration, creating new VMs, creating a CI/CD pipeline) - all of these things can be done with Ansible.

          <h2>INSTALLING ANSIBLE</h2>
          <pre class="language-yaml"><code data-noescape>
# the most common and preferred way of installation
$ pip install ansible

# install the epel-release RPM if needed on CentOS, RHEL, or Scientific Linux
$ sudo yum install ansible

# you will need the PPA repo configured
$ sudo apt-get install ansible
          </code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>There are many ways to install Ansible, including making your own rpm package, running from source, or you can just use a package manager.   As you can see, the examples below are using pip, yum, and apt.
              The yum and apt installations require additional steps so if you prefer using a single command, then you can install with pip.
                1 - Most common and preferred way (unless your Python is set up weird)
                2 - If you’re running a RHEL or CentOS type of machine, install epel-release and grab the package from there
                3- Ubuntu/Debian flavor OS
              If anything stumps you, it’s always helpful to take a look at the Ansible Installation documentation for more information.

            <p><img src="images/how_ansible_works.jpg"></p>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Once you have Ansible installed, you’re going to need to become acquainted with the key components of how Ansible works.
                The graphic on this slide shows the relationship between all the main pieces of Ansible, starting with the user who writes an Ansible playbook.

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>We talked a bit about modules in the previous couple slides, but I did want to point out a list of some commonly used modules that you may see out in example repos, blog posts, etc. a fair amount.
              Typically, you're going to see a lot of package management modules being used, lots of file modules like copy and file, but as mentioned previously, there are tons more as well.</p>

          <h2>MODULES: RUN COMMANDS</h2>
          <p><font color="52AAAC"><strong>If Ansible doesn’t have a module that suits your needs there are the “run command” modules:</strong></font><br><br></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>command:</strong> Takes the command and executes it. The most secure and predictable.</li>
            <li><strong>shell:</strong> Executes through a shell like /bin/sh so you can use pipes etc. Be careful.</li>
            <li><strong>script:</strong> Runs a local script on a remote node after transferring it.</li>
            <li><strong>raw:</strong> Executes a command  without going through the Ansible module subsystem.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Unlike standard modules, run commands have no concept of desired state and should only be used as a last resort</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>On this slide we’re gonna discuss the command and shell modules which are super useful because you can execute commands with them on your remote nodes.
              The only big difference is that the command is not processed through the shell so redirect options and certain variables won’t work.
              If you need those, just use the shell module instead.
              The command modules let you run networking commands with Ansible, the same way a network engineer would type them on the command line.

              If you have something that’s not a core module or you haven't written a custom one, you can utilize the script module.
              For example, if you want to push out a homegrown script, you can do that here.

              We also have the raw module, which issues a pure SSH command and bypasses the python module mechanism.
              This is handy if you’re talking to a machine that doesn’t have python (for example, a server that’s running Windows!).
            </p>

        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>AD-HOC COMMANDS</h2>
          <pre class="language-yaml"><code data-noescape>
            # check all my inventory hosts are ready to be managed by Ansible
            $ ansible all -m ping

            # run the uptime command on all hosts in the web group
            $ ansible web -m command -a “uptime”

            # collect and display the discovered for the localhost
            $ ansible localhost -m setup
          </code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>We’re going to transition right into ad-hoc commands from the commands modules because often times, you utilize command/shell to issue one-off commands to your hosts.
              This is essentially what ad-hoc commands are; just quick checks on your servers that you don’t want to preserve in an Ansible playbook.
              The examples here are pretty typical.
                Our first example is just checking whether we have connectivity with the host by issuing the ping command (I do this all the time to make sure everything is responding).
                In the second example here, you can see the command to check the uptime on the two servers in my web group using the command module.
                And lastly, the third example is gathering facts about our local machine which would yield the information that you can use for conditionals and variables and whatnot.
