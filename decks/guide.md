### This guide is meant to explain how to fill out our skeleton decks.
 Currently for internal use only but will be moving to community once a more stream lined approach is found.

##Creating and using the presentation

#The Slides
Each slide, starting from the very beginning can be found in the `<section>` headers. Once there, you can add anything you want in a number of ways. Depending on how you want to add them, you can add them with `<p> paragraphs` or with `<li> lists`

Speaker notes are found at the **bottom** of each section/slide. Before the section ends `</section>` there are the opening and close of `<aside>` which is where you can put your speaker notes.
